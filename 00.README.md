# TFM_Data_Science
## Data Science Master Final Project : Competition Margin Forecasting in Regulated Electricity Markets

### Summary
The nature of this project is double:
On one hand, the objective of this TFM is to simulate a real jobcase for a data scientist.
Instead of starting from a predefined point within all the data is already gathered and prepared, we are gonna search , explore and flow through the transformatios needed to reach that very far point.

On the other hand, due to my daily job I am on a possition of priviledge to compare all the tools learnt on this masters degree  with the ones I'm more used to in my job ( SQL, SAS ). 

For this second point, and even when most of the data used in this project is available to be downloaded directly from the REE oficial webpage  "https://www.ree.es/es/estadisticas-del-sistema-electrico-espanol", I've prefered to use internal infomation after having been anonimized. This way I will be able to compare exactly how it is working with (R & Python) vs (SQL & SAS)


### Previous Considerations
Every path on this project is a relative path, so since the whole folder is downloaded all together, it can be executed no matter where.


### Project Structure
This TFM is structured following two ideas:

The first one is the real data flow and how I have been developing it.

THe second one is the general structure of this document, where you can see the main points of it.
