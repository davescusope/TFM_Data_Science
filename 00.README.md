# TFM_Data_Science
## Data Science Master Final Project : Competition Margin Forecasting in Regulated Electricity Markets

### Summary
The nature of this project is double:
On one hand, the objective of this TFM is to simulate a real jobcase for a data scientist.
Instead of starting from a predefined point within all the data is already gathered and prepared, we are gonna search , explore and flow through the transformatios needed to reach that very far point.

On the other hand, due to my daily job I am on a possition of priviledge to compare all the tools learnt on this masters degree  with the ones I'm more used to in my job ( SQL, SAS ). 

For this second point, and even when most of the data used in this project is available to be downloaded directly from the REE oficial webpage  "https://www.ree.es/es/estadisticas-del-sistema-electrico-espanol", I've prefered to use internal infomation after having been anonymized. This way I will be able to compare exactly how it is working with (R & Python) vs (SQL & SAS)


### Previous Considerations
Every path on this project is a relative path, so since the whole folder is downloaded all together, it can be executed no matter where.

```
As mentioned before, I've opted for using information from my company after being previously anonymized.
For this purpose, there were used different procedures depending on the data-origin.

-For all those which came from an SQL data base, I used simple joins to replace all the data from the conflictive cells with the new ones. An example of the mulpliple SQL transformations can be watch on the links below

-For all those which came fron an csv, xlsx file, the process was based on a simple searchv function and replace the whole column with the new one(this included SAP information since it was extracted through an excel platform called E4E)


```

### Project Structure
This TFM has been structured following two different approaches:

The first one is the real data flow and how I have been developing it.
