# TFM_Data_Science
## Data Science Master Final Project : Competition Margin Forecasting in Regulated Electricity Markets

### Summary
The main objective of this TFM is to simulate a real jobcase for a data scientist.
Instead of starting from a predefined point within all the data is already gathered and prepared, we are gonna search , explore and flow through the transformatios needed to reach that very far point.

Most of data used in this project is available to be downloaded directly from the REE oficial webpage  "https://www.ree.es/es/estadisticas-del-sistema-electrico-espanol"
All data have been anonimized for possible asociations with any company

### Previous Considerations
Every path on this project is a relative path, so since the whole folder is downloaded all together, it can be executed wherever.
