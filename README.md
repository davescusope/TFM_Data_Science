# TFM_Data_Science
## Data Science Master Final Project : Competition Margin Forecasting in Regulated Electricity Markets

### Summary
The main objective of this TFM is to simulate a real jobcase for a data scientist.
Instead of starting from a predefined point within all the data is already gathered and prepared, we are gonna search , explore and flow through the transformatios needed to reach that very far point.

### Previous Considerations
Every path on this project is a relative path, so since the whole folder is downloaded all together, it can be executed wherever.
